# Undergraduate-Graduation-Project

Project C of 2020 Shenzhen Cup Mathematical Modeling (National Competition), 

is my 2022.6 undergraduate graduation design source code and thesis.

The code folder is the source code

The csv/mat/xlsm folder is the paper data

The md folder is Defense of the manuscript

The paper folder is Submitted paper

Note: This thesis for my undergraduate graduation was developed by myself, and its main inspiration came from the National Mathematical Modeling competition I participated in 2020. 

Of course, there was a lot wrong with what was written then, which I have completely revised in this article, and there are a lot of algorithmic features that lead to better conclusions. 

This is new paper, I don't recommend reading my (old)paper at the time, but I will still (old)paper url here:https://github.com/i12cu84/Mathematical-Modeling-Python
